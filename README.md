# Chen_2026_Task-similarity-dependent reconfiguration of compositional modules and geometry in frontal cortex

MATLAB code used for the population activity analyses reported in:

Chen, X., Yao, X., Yin, X., and Guo, Z. V. (2026).
Task-similarity-dependent reconfiguration of compositional modules and geometry in frontal cortex.

## Data availability
Single-trial PSTHs for each session analyzed in this study have been deposited in Zenodo and are available upon reasonable request at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21335457

## Data structure

All the Matlab code in this repository follows the data structure described below.

Each '.mat' file contains the following variables for a single recording session:

- PSTHs: Peri-stimulus time histograms with dimensions units × time × trials.

- TimeA: Time used to calculate the PSTHs. 

  TimeA.binsize: binsize to calcualte PSTHs (ms).

  TimeA.time: time points aligned to sample onset (s).

- Trials: Trial information and trial-type labels.

- Units: Cell array containing information for each unit (one cell corresponds to one unit).
